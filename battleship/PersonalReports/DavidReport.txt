     I felt that during the duration of this project, the group dynamic was
solid, and each member of our group made important contributions which facilitated
our success. My own personal contributions included general planning and
organization, contributing to building and testing the AI, implementing
inheritance, implementing graphics, and compiling/creating/editing all of the
images that we used. I initially helped with planning the basic structure of the 
program, and outlining the different classes and how they would communicate with
each other. I came up with the basic idea of how the program would be structured,
with vectors to keep track of each players board, ship objects to keep track of the
ships, and a graphical interface that is constantly updated based on these arrays 
and classes. Then, when it came to building the basic functionality of the program, I
assisted by creating various functions for the battleshipGame class, as well as 
joined together with Matt and Chris to create and test all aspects of the AI. Once we
had most of the basic AI and gameplay functionality completed, our entire group 
worked together for multiple days in order to implement the graphics. In the end, we
were all able to make essential contributions to the project, and I felt that each
of our group members pulled their own weight well. I enjoyed working on this project,
and I am very proud of the Battleship program that we created.

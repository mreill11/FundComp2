    For this project, our group worked very well together. We all brought our own skills to the table and
contributed solid work. One of my main projects was working on the AI, but I ended up creating an AI
that never lost. This was obviously unacceptable, so Chris worked on making it a more feasible opponent.
My original AI was too smart, it had access to the user board. A proper AI should only have access to what
it has already learned. Once we realized this, Chris and I finished a proper AI. One of my other main
roles in the group was working with the graphics. I created the sprite sheet we used to make the board using
GIMP. It was relatively simple, but getting it exactly the right size took some time. Once we had the sprite
sheet done, Chris and I worked through the SDL tutorials on Lazy Foo and began constructing the board. At
first, we were able to get the program to display a square in each corner of the screen. After a good amount
of trial and error, we finally had a 10 by 10 board. Chris then got the program to display both the user
and computer boards. The next problem we had to fix was making the squares continually render the proper
color. We did this by tracking both board vectors at render and coloring the squares accordingly. Overall,
our group worked very well together. We all contributed different things, as well as worked together to make
it all fit into place. This project, although tough at times, was very emnjoyable. It was rewarding to be
able to play our game once it was all finished.

Finish text based implementation of battleship (harder than expected) - 10
Compile various images and plan the general theme of the program - 10
Add graphics - 20

	The text based implementation proved slightly harder than expected 
and due to our focus on creating each of our own deliverables for lab 8, we
will move the completion of this step from lab 8 to the next step. We were
however able to use the SDL tutorials to get a decent handle on graphics,
and we are confident that we will soon be able to start adding graphics to
our program.
